## 1. Welcome to reenlever.com and the Interface!

These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to the reenlever.com website. The Services are provided by Reental DAO ("we," "us," or "our"). reenlever.com offers information and resources about the fundamentals of the decentralized and non-custodial peer-to-peer exchange protocol called the RNT Protocol. It is composed of self-executing open-source smart contracts deployed on the permissionless public Polygon blockchain. Reental DAO does not control or operate any version of the RNT Protocol on any blockchain network.

The Interface provides an application through which users, through their self-custodied wallets, interact with the RNT Protocol.

### You are entering into a binding agreement.

BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR SERVICES, WHICH INCLUDE OUR VARIOUS WEBSITES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, reenlever.com (AND ANY RESPECTIVE SUBDOMAIN); APPLICATIONS, AND OTHER SERVICES THAT LINK TO THESE TERMS, AS WELL AS ANY INFORMATION, TEXT, LINKS, GRAPHICS, PHOTOS, AUDIO, VIDEO, OR OTHER MATERIALS STORED, RETRIEVED, OR APPEARING THEREIN, WHETHER ACCESSED THROUGH THE SITE OR OTHERWISE

(COLLECTIVELY, THE "SERVICES"), YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT WITH US THAT INCLUDES THESE TERMS, THE PRIVACY POLICY (LOCATED HERE) AND OTHER POLICIES REFERENCED HERE (COLLECTIVELY, THE "AGREEMENT").
In the event there is a conflict between these Terms and any applicable additional terms, these Terms will control unless expressly stated otherwise. If you do not agree to these Terms, you should not use the Services or visit the Site or interact with the Services.

### Use of Services.

To use the Services, you must be legally capable of entering into the Agreement. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you meet the eligibility requirement. If you do not meet the requirement, you should not access or use the Site or the Services.

### We may update the Services and the Terms.

We may change or update the Services, the Agreement, and any part of the Terms at any time, for any reason, at our sole discretion. Once any part of the Agreement is updated and in effect, you will be subject to the Terms if you continue using the Services. We may, at any time and without liability to you, modify or discontinue all or part of the Services (including access to the Services through any third-party link).

## 2. Services

reenlever.com is an information resource about the Protocol; however, it is not the exclusive or only source. All information provided in connection with your access and use of the Services is for informational purposes only. While we strive to provide accurate and reliable information, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the information provided. Information may be outdated or subject to errors or omissions. The codebases of all versions of the RNT Protocol are maintained at each full node of the relevant blockchain network. You should not take, nor refrain from taking, any action based on the information contained in reenlever.com, or any other information we make available at any time, including blog posts, data, articles, links to third-party content, content in Discord, news, tutorials, tweets, and videos. Additionally, you acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable or assume any responsibility, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any content, goods, or services available on or through such site or resource.

### Users maintain full control over their cryptoassets.

It is important to understand that neither we nor any affiliated entity are part of any transaction on the underlying blockchain networks of the RNT Protocol; we do not have possession, custody, or control over any cryptoassets or the funds of any user. You understand that when you interact with the RNT Protocol, you maintain control over your cryptoassets at all times.

Users use third-party self-custodied wallets to interact with the RNT Protocol; we have no control or warranty over the wallets.

To interact with the RNT Protocol using the Interface, you will need to connect and use it through your self-custodied wallet. It is essential to understand that your self-custodied wallet is provided by a third-party entity and is generally governed by separate terms and conditions set by the respective third-party service provider. These terms and conditions may involve additional fees, disclaimers, or risk warnings regarding the accuracy and reliability of the information provided. Reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions associated with your chosen self-custodied wallet provider to ensure compliance and be aware of any applicable charges or risks is your sole responsibility.

### We are not intermediaries in the transactions of the RNT Protocol.

Due to the non-custodial and decentralized nature of the technology, we are not intermediaries, agents, advisors, or custodians, and we do not have a fiduciary duty or obligation to you in connection with any other decision or activity you undertake while using our Services.

We do not have information about all the transactions of the Protocol beyond what is publicly available through the blockchain.

You acknowledge that we do not have information about all the transactions of the RNT Protocol beyond what is available or obtainable publicly through the blockchain. However, we may collect information about the users of the Services in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

### There may be fees associated with the blockchain.

Transactions using blockchains may require the payment of gas fees, which are essentially network transaction fees paid on each transaction that occurs on the selected blockchain network. Please be aware that gas fees are non-refundable. We do not provide services to users nor deliver, maintain, or receive payments for cryptoassets. We do not receive any fees for any transaction or for the Services.

## 3. Assumption of Risks

### You assume the risks of participating in innovative and experimental technology.

Technologies such as smart contracts on various blockchains, cryptographic tokens generated by smart contracts, and other software, applications, and systems interacting with blockchain-based networks are experimental, speculative, inherently risky, and subject to change. Among other risks, errors, failures, cyberattacks, or changes in the applicable blockchain (e.g., forks) could disrupt these technologies and even result in a total loss of cryptoassets, their market value, or digital funds. We assume no liability or obligation for such risks. If you are not comfortable assuming these risks, you should not access or participate in transactions using blockchain-based technology.

### We are not responsible for any third-party service or link.

We are not responsible for the content or services of third parties, including, among others, any network or applications such as Discord or MetaMask, and we make no representations regarding the content or accuracy of third-party services or materials. Your use and access to any third-party product or service, including through the Services, is at your own risk. Be aware that we have no control over third-party services. Therefore, we cannot guarantee, endorse, or recommend such content or services to users of the Interface, nor can we endorse their use for any specific purpose.

### You agree to the automatic collection and distribution of profits by smart contracts.

You acknowledge and agree that all transactions accessed through blockchain-based networks will be processed automatically using one or more smart contracts. By conducting transactions using the Services, you acknowledge and consent to the automatic processing of all transactions in connection with the use of the Services. Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that the applicable smart contract will dictate how funds from a transaction are distributed and the ownership of the cryptoassets.

### You acknowledge the risks of using the Services.

You take responsibility for evaluating the Services before using them, and all transactions on the blockchain are irrevocable, final, and non-refundable. The Services may be disabled, interrupted, or adversely affected as a result of sophisticated cyberattacks, increases in activity, computer viruses, and/or other operational or technical challenges, among other things. We waive any ongoing obligation to notify you of all possible risks of using and accessing our Services. You accept these risks and agree that you will not seek to hold any Indemnified Party of Reental DAO liable for any consequential loss.

### You are solely responsible for the security of your self-custodied wallet.

You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your self-custodied wallet. You are solely responsible for securing your private keys. We do not have access to your private keys. Any unauthorized access to your self-custodied wallet by third parties could result in the loss or theft of any cryptoassets or funds held in your account and any associated accounts. You understand and agree that we have no involvement, and we do not take responsibility for managing and maintaining the security of your self-custodied wallet. The private key associated with the address of the self-custodied wallet from which you transfer cryptoassets or the associated private key is the only private key that can control the cryptoassets you transfer to the smart contracts.

### We reserve the right to restrict your access to the Services.

You agree that we have the right to restrict your access to the Services by any technically available method if we suspect, at our sole discretion, that (a) you are using the Services for money laundering or any illegal activity; (b) you have engaged in fraudulent activities; (c) you have acquired cryptoassets using inappropriate methods, including the use of stolen funds to purchase such assets; (d) you are the target of any sanction administered or applied by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury ("OFAC"), the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, Her Majesty's Treasury, or any other legal or regulatory authority in any applicable jurisdiction; (e) you, as an individual or entity, or your wallet address is listed on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List ("SDN List"), Consolidated Sanctions Lists ("Non-SDN Lists"), or any other sanctions list administered by OFAC; (f) you are located, organized, or reside in a country or territory that is, or whose government is, subject to sanctions, including but not limited to Côte d'Ivoire, Cuba, Belarus, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria; or (g) you have otherwise acted in violation of these Terms. If we have a reasonable suspicion that you are using the Services for illegal purposes, we reserve the right to take the actions we deem appropriate.

### We do not guarantee the quality or accessibility of the Services.

As a condition of accessing or using the Services, you acknowledge, understand, and agree that from time to time, the Services may be inaccessible or inoperable for any reason, including, but not limited to, equipment malfunctions, periodic maintenance or repairs, causes beyond our control or that we could not reasonably foresee, interruptions, and temporary or permanent unavailability of underlying blockchain infrastructure or unavailability of third-party service providers or external partners for any reason.

You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Services at your own risk. You should not engage in blockchain-based transactions unless they are suitable given your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Services, you declare that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for conducting your own due diligence on the risks of a transaction and the underlying smart contracts and cryptoassets.

## 4. Taxes

### You are responsible for your taxes and duties.

Users assume sole responsibility for paying any and all taxes, duties, and assessments now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority associated with their use of the Services and/or payable as a result of the use and/or exploitation of any cryptoassets and interaction with smart contracts. Blockchain-based transactions are novel, and their tax treatment is uncertain.

### Agreement to Try to Resolve Disputes Through Good Faith Negotiations

Before initiating any legal proceeding against us of any kind, including an arbitration as set forth below, you and we agree that we will try to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy between us arising out of or related to the agreement or the Services (each, a "Dispute" and, collectively, "Disputes") by engaging in good faith negotiations. Such good faith negotiations require, at a minimum, that the aggrieved party provide written notice to the other party specifying the nature and details of the dispute. The party receiving such notice will have thirty (30) days to respond to the notice. Within sixty (60) days after sending the initial notice by the aggrieved party, the parties will meet and confer in good faith by videoconference or by phone to try to resolve the Dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within ninety (90) days after the initial notice was sent by the aggrieved party, the parties may agree to mediate the Dispute, or either party may submit the Dispute to arbitration as set forth below.

### Agreement to Arbitrate

You and we agree that any Dispute that cannot be resolved through the procedures set forth above will be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the International Arbitration Rules of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution. The arbitration will take place in Delaware. The language of the arbitration will be English. The arbitrator(s) will have experience in adjudicating matters involving internet technology, software applications, financial transactions, and, preferably, blockchain technology. The arbitrator's award on damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" subsection of these Terms in terms of the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of its reasonable attorney's fees and costs. Except as required by law, neither party nor any of its representatives may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both/all parties.

UNLESS YOU TIMELY PROVIDE US WITH AN ARBITRATION OPT-OUT NOTICE (AS DEFINED BELOW IN THE SUBSECTION TITLED "YOUR OPTIONS"), YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND WE WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. FURTHERMORE, UNLESS YOU AND WE OTHERWISE AGREE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
